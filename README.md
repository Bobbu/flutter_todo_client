# flutter_todo_client

Simple Flutter todo client to access the fast-todo API.

## Getting Started

This Flutter client accesses the same FastAPI-based API we produced in Travis Media's tutorial on FastAPI. Since he only provided a React client, this might help others who are more familiar with Flutter/Dart than React.

After the first two tutorials, Travis has a third tutorial where you build out and test the API via a React.js app. I also share a public implementation from the [react-todo-client repo](https://github.com/Bobbu/react-todo-client), which you can clone or download a copy to avoid building your own.

Here are a few resources to get you started on this specific effort:

Start with this 21-minute tutorial to create a Todo API:
Travis Media's [Why You NEED To Learn FastAPI | Hands-On Project](https://youtu.be/cbASjoZZGIw?si=QpsWVHCHM9brUv1K)

I strongly recommend you move on to the second tutorial that moves from an in-memory/transient list of todos to a SQLlite-based persistent one, the tutorial video you can find at Travis' [Dev Importers Community](https://community.travis.media/).

I publicly share an implementation of what is taught in the first two tutorials, and I will also make that available here on GitHub.  Clone or download a copy of the [fast-todo repo](https://github.com/Bobbu/fast-todos) if you want to avoid building one yourself.

Finally, here are the default/stock resources to get you started if this is your first Flutter project:

- [Lab: Write your first Flutter app](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/codelab)
- [Cookbook: Useful Flutter samples](https://docs.flutter.dev/cookbook)

For help getting started with Flutter development, view the
[online documentation](https://docs.flutter.dev/), which offers tutorials,
samples, guidance on mobile development, and a full API reference.
