# flutter_todo_client

Simple Flutter todo client to access the fast-todo API.

## Getting Started

This is a Flutter client that accesses the same FastAPI-based API that we produced in Travis Media's tutorial on FastAPI. Since he only provided a React client, I figured this might help others who are more familiar with Flutter/Dart than React.

A few resources to get you started on this specific effort:

Start with this 21 minute tutorial to create a Todo API:
Travis Media's [Why You NEED To Learn FastAPI | Hands On Project](https://youtu.be/cbASjoZZGIw?si=QpsWVHCHM9brUv1K)

I strongly recommend you move on to the second tutorial that moves from an in-memory/transient list of todos to a SQLlite-based persistent one, the tutorial video you can find at Travis' [Dev Importers Community](https://community.travis.media/).

Finally, here are the default/stock resources to get you started if this is your first Flutter project:

- [Lab: Write your first Flutter app](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/codelab)
- [Cookbook: Useful Flutter samples](https://docs.flutter.dev/cookbook)

For help getting started with Flutter development, view the
[online documentation](https://docs.flutter.dev/), which offers tutorials,
samples, guidance on mobile development, and a full API reference.
